WHAT IT DOES
Beacon serves as a comprehensive platform where budding entrepreneurs can navigate the complexities of starting and growing their businesses. By leveraging cutting-edge technology such as XRPL and PropelAuth, it provides tools for financial transactions, secure authentication, and data visualization, all integrated through a user-friendly interface built with JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap CSS.

HOW WE BUILT IT 
Our journey began with the integration of XRPL for robust transaction capabilities, followed by PropelAuth for secure user authentication. The frontend was meticulously crafted using React and Bootstrap CSS to ensure a seamless user experience. We also incorporated Chart.js for data visualization, providing clear, actionable insights. Throughout the development process, our team adhered to agile methodologies, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness to feedback.
